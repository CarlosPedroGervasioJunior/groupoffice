1. Setup an oauth app in google:

https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2


## Development environment (docker)

When using the official [Group Office development environment](https://github.com/Intermesh/docker-groupoffice-development),
please be sure to set the URL to http://localhost:8000 in the system settings. Localhost is
the only non-https URL that is commonly accepted by OAuth servers. This applies to at least
Google and Azure.
